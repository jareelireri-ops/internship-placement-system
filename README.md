#  Student Internship Portal

Welcome to the Lucky-You Internship Portal! This is a modular Python-based system designed to handle student registrations, secure logins, and internship applications through a clean command-line interface.

## 📂 Project Structure

To keep the code clean and professional, I've organized the logic into specific modules:

* **`main.py`**: The central hub. This runs the main menu loop and coordinates between the user and the other modules.
* **`auth.py`**: The security layer. It handles user registration, password verification, and includes a "bouncer" (decorator) to protect restricted areas.
* **`course_internship.py`**: The data hub. This contains the catalog of courses and specific internship programs.
* **`data_mgt.py`**: The database manager. It handles all the "heavy lifting" of reading and writing user data to the JSON file.
* **`users.json`**: Our local database. This file is automatically generated the moment the first user registers.

##  How to Run

1.  **Check Python: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2.  **Folder Setup: Keep all `.py` files in the same folder.
3.  **Launch: Open your terminal in that folder and run:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

##  Features

* **Data Persistence**: Your user data isn't lost when you close the program; it's saved securely in a local JSON file.
* **Session Security**: The system uses a `@login_required` decorator, ensuring that only authenticated users can browse the internship catalog.
* **Modular Architecture**: The code is separated by "concerns," making it easy to scale or update specific parts without breaking the whole system.
